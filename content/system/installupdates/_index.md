Also, please note that if there are frequent **power cuts** in your area, you should only install updates when you are most certain that power wonâ€™t be cut. If your computer **shuts down** in the **middle of an update** due to a power outage or the laptop battery dying, it can **corrupt** your operating system. This can result in you losing access to your files stored on the computer. So do take care.
