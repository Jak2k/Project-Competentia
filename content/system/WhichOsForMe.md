## What is an Operating System?

An operating system, or OS for short, is a software program that manages your computer's hardware resources and provides services to other software programs. It acts as the bridge between you and the computer's hardware, making it possible for you to interact with your computer and run applications. Examples of popular operating systems include Windows, macOS, and Linux. Think of the OS as the foundation that enables your computer to function properly and for you to perform tasks such as browsing the web, creating documents, and playing games.
