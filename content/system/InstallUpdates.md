Installing the latest updates is one of the most important things you can do to keep your computer secure. Updates are released to fix security vulnerabilities and to add new features. If you don't install the latest updates, you are leaving your computer vulnerable to attack.

## Desktop

### Windows

#### Windows 10

By default, Windows 10 downloads and installs updates automatically in the background. However, there may be times when you want to manually check for and install updates. To do that, you just need to follow the steps mentioned below:

**Step 1**: Click on the **Windows** icon in the lower left corner of the screen.

**Step 5**: There are two scenarios possible here:

  a.	There are no updates available for your device. That means your device is up-to-date. You can stop reading the tutorial.
 
  b.	There are some updates available for your device. In this case, Windows will automatically start downloading the update files for you.

**Step 6**: If any updates start downloading, wait for them to finish downloading.

**Step 7**: Once the updates finish downloading, You can either **restart your system now to install the updates or choose to restart later**. In case you choose to restart later, keep in mind that whenever you switch on your PC next, Windows will automatically start installing the updates.

Also, please note that if there are frequent **power cuts** in your area, you should only install updates when you are most certain that power wonâ€™t be cut. If your computer **shuts down** in the **middle of an update** due to a power outage or the laptop battery dying, it can **corrupt** your operating system. This can result in you losing access to your files stored on the computer. So do take care.

If you are using an older version of Windows, you should upgrade to Windows 10. If you are unable to upgrade, you should disconnect it from the internet and only use it for offline tasks.
You could also consider installing a Linux distribution.
